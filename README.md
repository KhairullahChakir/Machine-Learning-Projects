# 🤖 Machine Learning Projects  

Welcome to my collection of **Machine Learning projects** — a growing library of experiments, models, and mini case studies built to understand ML from the ground up.  

Each folder in this repository contains a complete, independent project with its own dataset, code, and results.

## 🎯 Goal  
Learn ML by building everything from zero — no black-box models, no shortcuts. Each project aims to understand *how* things actually work behind the scenes.
